 	Began: 6.8.03
	Author: Joshua S. Curtis
	Dev Env: java 1.4, Windows XP

	Need to coagulate my thought process on this one. Maybe
	I shoulda done some design first. Ah well...


	

   SUMMARY:

	The basic premise of this project is to build a real-time(?)
   spectral analysis tool in java. The program's primary ( and for a while only)
   input is the preferred mic input in windows. 
	Some consideration was required to balance the frequency resolution
   of the visualization with the overall speed and usability of the 
   java language in a RT implementation of this kind. 
   
	f_d = delta f, or the distance, in Hz ,between the closest 
		of two frequency amplitudes returned by the fft calculation.

	f_d = 1/( N * T)

		where, 
			N = sample size of fft input buffer
			T = sampling period, in this case 1/44100

   	The first version of JSpect uses a fft buffer size of 8k (8192) 
   samples. This gives us a fairly accurate frequency resolution for
   the visualization. 
   	
	f_d = ~5.4Hz

   	more sometime...

   
   VERSION NOTES:

   	1.0 ::::: 
		Initial attempt at the project. Some successes in design, 
	   some very annoying inconsistancies in the output.


   TESTING:

	Exploratory:
		Need to test the value range of javasound api. Shove pink noise
	at full volume(0db) from some source (probably from another computer) to
	find the maximum value returned by javasound's read().

	Frequency Correctness:
		Need to hook up the project to a signal generator, possibly
	with a sweep ability.


   OTHER NOTES:
   	build small preamp(simple) for development purposes
		see Favorites List

	Need to install MATLAB, could help verify testing
